# ðŸ§  A/B Testing with Multi-Armed Bandits

This project demonstrates a simulation-based comparison of **Epsilon-Greedy** and **Thompson Sampling** algorithms on a 2-armed bandit problem. The goal is to optimize ad selection using reinforcement learning techniques, monitor the learning process, and visualize the results.
